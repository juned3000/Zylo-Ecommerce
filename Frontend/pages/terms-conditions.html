            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 1, 2025</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By accessing, browsing, or using the Zylo website ("Website"), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Zylo regarding your use of our website and services. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must not use our website or services.</p>
            
            <p>Your continued use of our website following any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. We reserve the right to update, change, or replace any part of these Terms at our sole discretion.</p>

            <h2>2. Definitions and Interpretation</h2>
            <p>For the purposes of these Terms, the following definitions apply: "Company," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Zylo, the operator of this e-commerce platform. "Service" refers to the website, mobile applications, and all related services provided by Zylo. "User," "you," and "your" refer to any individual who accesses or uses our Service. "Products" refers to all merchandise, goods, and items available for purchase through our platform.</p>
            
            <p>"Account" refers to the user profile created when you register with us. "Order" means your request to purchase Products from us. "Content" includes all text, graphics, images, logos, trademarks, and other materials on our website.</p>

            <h2>3. Account Registration and Security</h2>
            <p>To access certain features of our website and to make purchases, you may be required to create an account. When creating an account, you must provide accurate, current, and complete information as prompted by our registration form. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>
            
            <p>You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account information. You may not use another person's account without permission, and you may not allow anyone else to use your account.</p>
            
            <p>We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders at our sole discretion, particularly if we suspect fraudulent activity or violation of these Terms.</p>

            <h2>4. Product Information, Availability, and Pricing</h2>
            <p>We strive to provide accurate descriptions, images, and pricing information for all products on our website. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions, colors, images, or other content is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Product images are for illustrative purposes only and may not reflect the exact appearance of the actual product.</p>
            
            <p>All prices displayed on our website are in Indian Rupees (INR) and are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to modify prices at any time, including after you have submitted an order, but we will provide notice of any price changes before processing your payment. In the event of a pricing error, we reserve the right to cancel orders placed at the incorrect price.</p>
            
            <p>Product availability is subject to change without notice. While we make every effort to ensure that our inventory information is accurate, we cannot guarantee that all products shown as available will be in stock when you place your order. If a product becomes unavailable after you place an order, we will notify you and offer alternatives or a full refund.</p>

            <h2>5. Order Process and Payment</h2>
            <p>When you place an order through our website, you are making an offer to purchase the selected products subject to these Terms. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason, including but not limited to product availability, errors in product or pricing information, or suspected fraudulent activity.</p>
            
            <p>Receipt of an order confirmation email does not constitute our acceptance of your order. Our acceptance occurs when we ship the products to you, at which point a contract for sale is formed between you and us. We reserve the right to cancel orders even after sending a confirmation email if we discover errors or if products become unavailable.</p>
            
            <p>Payment must be received in full before we process your order. We accept various payment methods including major credit cards, debit cards, net banking, digital wallets, and other payment options as displayed during checkout. All payments are processed through secure, encrypted channels using industry-standard security protocols. By providing payment information, you authorize us to charge the specified amount for your purchase, including applicable taxes and shipping fees.</p>

            <h2>6. Shipping, Delivery, and Risk of Loss</h2>
            <p>We offer shipping to addresses within India through various shipping partners. Shipping costs, delivery timeframes, and available shipping options will be displayed during checkout and may vary based on your location, the size and weight of your order, and the shipping method selected.</p>
            
            <p>Delivery times are estimates only and are not guaranteed. We are not responsible for delays caused by shipping carriers, weather conditions, natural disasters, or other circumstances beyond our control. Title and risk of loss for products pass to you upon delivery to the shipping carrier.</p>
            
            <p>You must inspect packages upon delivery and report any damage or missing items within 48 hours of delivery. We require a signature for delivery, and packages left unattended are at your risk. If you will not be available to receive your order, please arrange for someone else to accept delivery or consider having your order shipped to an alternative address.</p>

            <h2>7. Returns, Exchanges, and Refunds</h2>
            <p>We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If you are not satisfied for any reason, you may return eligible items within 30 days of the delivery date for a refund or exchange. To be eligible for return, items must be in their original condition, unworn, unwashed, and with all original tags and packaging intact.</p>
            
            <p>Certain items are not eligible for return, including but not limited to: intimate apparel, swimwear, customized or personalized items, gift cards, and items marked as final sale. For hygiene and safety reasons, these items cannot be returned unless they arrive damaged or defective.</p>
            
            <p>To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team or use our online return portal. You will be provided with return instructions and a return authorization number. Return shipping costs may apply unless the return is due to our error or a defective product. Refunds will be processed within 5-10 business days after we receive and inspect the returned items, and will be issued to your original payment method.</p>

            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time at our sole discretion. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms and may provide additional notice as appropriate under the circumstances.</p>
