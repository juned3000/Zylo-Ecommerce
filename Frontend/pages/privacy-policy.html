            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 1, 2025</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Zylo's Privacy Policy. Your privacy is critically important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website or make a purchase from us. Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access our site or services.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <h3>Personal Information You Provide</h3>
            <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on our website, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter, respond to a survey, fill out a form, or otherwise interact with us. This information may include your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, payment card information, and any other information you choose to provide.</p>
            
            <p>When you make a purchase, we collect information necessary to complete your transaction, including your billing and shipping addresses, payment method details, and order preferences. We may also collect information about your shopping preferences, product reviews, and feedback to improve our services and provide personalized recommendations.</p>

            <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
            <p>When you visit our website, we automatically collect certain information about your device and usage patterns. This includes your IP address, browser type and version, operating system, referring website, pages viewed, time spent on pages, access times, and other diagnostic data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements, and gather demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
            
            <p>We also collect information through cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies. These technologies help us remember your preferences, understand how you use our website, and improve your overall experience. You can control the use of cookies through your browser settings, though disabling cookies may affect some functionality of our website.</p>

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect for various legitimate business purposes, including to process and fulfill your orders, manage your account, and provide customer service. When you place an order, we use your information to process payment, arrange shipping, send order confirmations, and provide updates on your delivery status.</p>
            
            <p>We may use your information to communicate with you about your account, orders, and our services. This includes sending you important notices about changes to our terms, privacy policy, or other policies that affect you. With your consent, we may also send you promotional emails about new products, special offers, and other information that may interest you.</p>
            
            <p>Your information helps us improve our website, products, and services. We analyze usage patterns and customer feedback to enhance user experience, develop new features, and optimize our offerings. We also use your information to prevent fraudulent transactions, monitor against theft, and protect against criminal activity.</p>

            <h2>4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>We respect your privacy and do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. However, we may share your information in certain limited circumstances to provide our services and protect our business interests.</p>
            
            <p>We work with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, and serving you. These parties include payment processors, shipping companies, email service providers, and website analytics services. These service providers have access to your personal information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated to keep your information confidential.</p>
            
            <p>We may disclose your information when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. Our website uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology to protect your data during transmission. All payment information is processed through secure, PCI-compliant payment processors, and we do not store your complete payment card information on our servers.</p>
            
            <p>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your information. Our staff is trained on privacy and security procedures, and access to personal information is limited to employees who need it to perform their job functions. We regularly review and update our security practices to ensure the ongoing protection of your data.</p>
            
            <p>While we strive to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, but we are committed to protecting your information using industry-standard security measures.</p>

            <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p>We use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies to enhance your browsing experience and provide personalized content. Cookies are small data files stored on your device that help us remember your preferences, keep you logged in, and analyze how you use our website.</p>
            
            <p>We use both session cookies, which expire when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on your device for a specified period. These cookies help us provide features like shopping cart functionality, personalized product recommendations, and targeted advertising.</p>
            
            <p>You can control cookie settings through your browser preferences. Most browsers allow you to refuse cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you disable cookies, some features of our website may not function properly, and your user experience may be limited.</p>

            <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>You have several rights regarding your personal information, and we are committed to helping you exercise these rights. You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you and to receive a copy of this information in a commonly used format.</p>
            
            <p>If any of your personal information is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct or update it. You can update most of your information through your account settings, or you can contact us directly for assistance.</p>
            
            <p>You have the right to request that we delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions such as when we need to retain information for legal compliance or legitimate business purposes. You also have the right to object to or restrict certain processing of your information, and to withdraw consent where we rely on consent as the legal basis for processing.</p>
            
            <p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided at the end of this policy. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable law.</p>

            <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including to provide our services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. The specific retention period depends on the type of information and the purpose for which it was collected.</p>
            
            <p>Account information and transaction records are typically retained for seven years after account closure or the last transaction, as required by applicable accounting and tax laws. Marketing communications data may be retained for up to three years unless you opt out of marketing communications, in which case we will delete or anonymize this information sooner.</p>
            
            <p>When we no longer need your personal information, we will securely delete or anonymize it in accordance with our data retention and disposal policies.</p>

            <h2>9. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
            <p>Our website may contain links to third-party websites, applications, or services that are not owned or controlled by Zylo. This privacy policy does not apply to these third-party sites, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices or content.</p>
            
            <p>We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit through links on our website. These third parties may have different privacy practices, and their collection and use of your information will be governed by their own privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our services are not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>
            
            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so we can address the situation appropriately.</p>

            <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. When we transfer your information internationally, we implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information remains protected.</p>
            
            <p>We rely on various legal mechanisms for international transfers, including adequacy decisions, standard contractual clauses, and other lawful transfer mechanisms as approved by relevant data protection authorities.</p>

            <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and notify you of any material changes.</p>
            
            <p>For significant changes that materially affect your rights or how we use your information, we will provide more prominent notice, such as sending you an email notification or displaying a notice on our website. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically to stay informed about our privacy practices.</p>
            
            <p>Your continued use of our services after any changes to this privacy policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
